Bitmap Maniac V2
================

*Partial Prototype for a future game*
##Overview

The primary purpose for Bitman Maniac is to explore the possiblity for a monster spritesheet to be generated on the fly based off of unique parameters decided by a variety of gameplay mechanics, dubbed DNA for the time being.  

##Current State

This a single C# file to aid the Monsters. And includes the prototype of Colour, a quantizing colour module.

##TODO
Refactor Each Function to a repectible C# class. 

##Note

This is Version Two in the sence that V1 was getting used to Unity as a Development Environment. Version Two will be more than exploring the game engine.
